- 👋 Hi, I’m @RohinMaharaja
- 👀 I’m interested in everything: mathematics, computer science, philosophy, ethics, history, science (never got into chemistry but I find fundamental physics and evolutionary biology fascinating (popular science)), politics, you name it!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning, some statistics and probability theory, differential forms, and a bunch of computer science stuff. Also getting into AI ethics!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something, just don't know yet.
- 📫 How to reach me: not entirely sure why you'd want to, so...
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him  
- ⚡ Fun fact: that I don't have the ability to find fun facts.
